# CloudResume
ðŸ“„ About This Project
I built this Cloud Resume to showcase real, hands-on cloud engineering skills, not just list them on a resume.

This project is based on the [Cloud Resume Challenge](url), which was created to help aspiring cloud professionals prove their capabilities by building something end to end using real cloud services. Instead of only learning theory or earning certifications, this challenge required me to design, deploy, and continuously integrate a real resume site using cloud-native technologies.



ðŸŽ¯ Goals of the Challenge
  -Demonstrate proficiency with AWS services like S3, CloudFront, Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, and IAM
  
  -Gain experience with infrastructure as code using tools like Terraform or AWS SAM
  
  -Implement CI/CD pipelines to push updates automatically through GitHub Actions or similar
  
  -Learn and apply frontend development (HTML/CSS) by creating a professional resume website
  
  -Prove an understanding of serverless architecture, security best practices, and version control

This wasnâ€™t just about building a website. It was about proving I can build, deploy, and maintain scalable, secure, and well-architected cloud solutions.
